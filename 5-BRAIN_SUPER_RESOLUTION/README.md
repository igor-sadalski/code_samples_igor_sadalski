# DGL Kaggle Competition: SuperBLTGraph by GrafT-Heory
This is the repository of the Kaggle Competition team GrafT-Heory. The team members are Yasmine Hemmati, Alex Iordachescu, Hugo Frelin, Igor Sadalski and Alan Piccuci. Our model has the name SuperBLTGraph, which stands for Super Brain Low-resolution Transformation Graph, but also refers to the sandwich arctitecture of the network.


### Instructions:
By running submissions.ipynb, on trains our model using 3-fold cross validation, with results being plotted, and then lastly trains it on the full dataset. The final training also saves an example kaggle competition csv. The notebook is ready to be run as is, one only needs to adjust the paths to the data files.

### File descriptions:


- **MatrixVectorizer.py**: Contains the class MatrixVectorizer which allows for easy conversion of matrices to vectors and vice versa.

- **model.py**: Contains the layers of and the full model developed, named SimpleBrainNet.

- **train.py**: Contains the training loop for which SimpleBrainNet is trained.

- **utils.py**: Contains helper functionality such as functions for loading data and plotting results.

- **3_fold_results.png**: The scores and metrics generated by running submission.ipynb.
